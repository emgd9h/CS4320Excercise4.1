Emgd9h 4.1 Individual Assignment-2 paragraphs
	I believe that the Edward Snowden case runs into a few different ethical issues. The first being public, which should always come first. Snowden can argue that he was working "consistently with the publics interest" by revealing that laws were being broken towards the public, which the public widely agrees is unethical. To ensue this is the most important and takes precedence, thinking with the public interest first should be apperant in Socio-Technical, Technical, and and individual systems. This would include confidentiality of the client as well. To ensure that "collegues" and "Self", are far lower than public on importance, they should not be present in all three systems. This is why I only marked Socio-technical system for colleagues and indivdual system for self. I personally believe that Snowden kept to the ethical principals and made the correct decision as a whistleblower although it was a difficult one.
	One could also argue that although the public being informed is great, there are certain indivuals and groups within that public are the reason they were being monitored. So now that this monitoring is public knowledge, it actually made the general public less safe and harder to be protected by the NSA. It is hard for the public to actually know what their own public interest is here in this situation is, so possibly relying on the employers judgement and then attempting to follow the remainder of ethical principles to guide. This is why this was such controversial decision by Snowden as it really was hard for him to sort through the different levels of ethics while going through with the work he felt broke these principles.
